I trained as an accountant—BSc in Administration (Accounting)—where I learned to think in <span class=\"highlight\">unit economics</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">margin architecture</span>, and <span class=\"highlight\">risk mitigation</span>. But I taught myself to <em>build</em>. Today, I am currently pursuing a second degree in Computer Science and I lead R&D in Go, Python, and React, architecting backend systems that scale to millions.",
      "This dual fluency is my moat.",
      "In venture building, most technical founders bleed runway chasing product-market fit. Most finance-first operators can't iterate fast enough to survive. <strong>I do both.</strong> I model the CAC:LTV ratios <em>before</em> I write the first microservice. I stress-test the P&L <em>while</em> the codebase compiles.",
